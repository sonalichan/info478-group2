## Analysis for Line Plot
This graph shows the number of people over 18 years old who experienced mental illness
over the years of 2008 to 2018. As the data is shown based on the county type, it seems
that a lot more people who live in larger cities experience mental illness, and this could
be dependent on the stresses that come along with living in larger urban areas. However,
the data could be skewing this way because those who live in smaller counties, where
they ar completely urban or non metropolitan could be not accurately represented by this
graph because they did not have access to record mental illness or a way to address these
concerns with help due to their remote locations.
